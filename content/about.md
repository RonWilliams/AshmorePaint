Established in 1911, we are the only locally owned paint store in Corpus Christi. We carry every thing you need to complete your project including Paints, Stains, Lacquers, Brushes and more. Ashmore Paint is proud to participate in Benjamin Moore's Signature Store Program. 

The Signature Store Program is only awarded to the very best Benjamin Moore distributors. We are also a member / owner of "ALLPRO®". ALLPRO® Corporation is a business-to-business buying cooperative comprised of a network of independently owned paint and decorating products dealers throughout the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and parts of Europe. This affiliation provides us direct access to over 200 of the largest and best manufactures serving the paint industry.

Being locally owned gives us the ability to best know and serve our customers. Our direct access to manufactures keeps our prices and product offerings very competitive. We have what it takes to help you through your next painting project. If we don’t stock your specialty product, we will find it. We are professionals and we will guide you through your project, regardless of the size. So whether you are painting one wall or a Pro doing an entire house we have what you need to get the job done right.
